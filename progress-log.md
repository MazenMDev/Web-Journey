# 📅 Progress Log

Welcome to my detailed learning journal for **Web-Journey**.  
Here I record what I study, build, and achieve week by week as I work toward becoming a skilled full-stack web developer.

## Notes
- I update this file about once a week or whenever I complete a major task or topic.  
- Each month will have its own section for clear progress tracking.  
- Big milestones (like finishing a course or deploying a project) will be marked with ⭐.
