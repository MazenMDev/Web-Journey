Welcome to my **Web Journey**, my personal front-end & full-stack web development learning repository.  
Here I collect projects, experiments, and mini-challenges as I build toward becoming a skilled full-stack developer. 🚀

---

## Current Goals
- Master **JavaScript** and understand its core concepts deeply.  
- Build **small projects** to apply what I learn and strengthen problem-solving.  
- Improve **code practices**: clean, organized, and maintainable code.

Clone this repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/MazenMDev/Web-Journey.git
